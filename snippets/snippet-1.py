# Cooking with Python

# This mini-game demonstrates some of the basic functionality
# provided within Python. The mini-game will make use of
# variables and conditional branching to create a game flow.

# The premise of the game is to make a perfect burger. First,
# the user must choose a recipe. After the recipe is chosen,
# ingredients will be presented to be taken out, to cook, or
# to store. Each of the beforehand tasks will take time
# to do which will affect the status of the ingredient. To
# make a perfect burger, the user will need to time the use
# of all ingredients in a strategic manner.

# This section will declare the variables to be used throughout
# the program.
